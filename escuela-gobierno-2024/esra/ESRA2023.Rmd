???
1- we are all aware of the existence and persistence of gender pay gaps

2- this is a worldwide phenomenon with large variance between countries, but that in OECD average is about 12 percent

3- most of the research in this area is related to sociostructural factors, but we know little about the extent to which this problem is 1) perceived by the population, 2) if this is something considered unjust or not. 

4- awareness of this problem, specially from the side of women is relevant given that if this situation is misperceived it is difficult to expect reduction of the gender pay gap

# Discussion

- perceived and just gaps by gender: women perceive and justify lower salaries and gaps (same-gender referent theory?)

- no evidence so far for the gender of the occupation  

- limitation: fixed blocks for occupational gender in study 2; pay gaps not possible

- further research: longitudinal survey alternating the gender of the occupations
